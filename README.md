## Hi there 👋

### ✨ About Me
My name is Theophilus Ngaribvume. Currently employed at Pindula. As the only developer at [Pindula](https://www.pindula.co.zw/) I'm responsible for everything from web designing, developing, deploying, and server management. Beyond Pindula, I'm a passionate open-source advocate, always trying to help other developers build faster and more efficiently by providing them with project boilerplates.

### :rocket: What I'm currently working on.
1. :baggage_claim: Django eCommerce Boilerplate (Django 4.2.2, TailwindCSS)
2. :information_desk_person: Django Blog Boilerplate (Django 4.2.2, TailwindCSS)
3. :secret: Zvaita App - An app that helps users find or call a mobile doctor. I'm building it using React Native (Expo), Firebase (Firestore), and Cloud Messaging.
