## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### âœ¨ About Me
My name is Theophilus Ngaribvume. Currently employed at Pindula. As the only developer at [Pindula](https://www.pindula.co.zw/) I'm responsible for everything from web designing, developing, deploying, and server management. Beyond Pindula, I'm a passionate open-source advocate, always trying to help other developers build faster and more efficiently by providing them with project boilerplates.

### :mortar_board: Education
I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Zimbabwe and graduated in 2020 with a 2.1 degree classification. The degree was theory intensive, more like theoretical computer science. With more emphasis on computation and algorithm efficiency.
